                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>
                To deliver a high-performance, user-friendly DEX interface that allows users to trade tokens and engage in DeFi activities on the Binance Smart Chain, with Web3.js integration to facilitate secure wallet connections and transaction signing.<br/><br/>
                React.js: Used to create the interactive and responsive front-end of the application. React enabled the development of reusable UI components, delivering a consistent user experience across the platform.<br/><br/>
                Web3.js: Employed to facilitate blockchain interactions, such as connecting with BSC-compatible wallets, retrieving blockchain data, and signing transactions.<br/><br/>
                Binance Smart Chain (BSC): The blockchain network providing fast and low-cost transactions, critical for the DEXâ€™s user base.<br/><br/>
                Smart Contracts: BEP-20 token contracts and custom smart contracts for liquidity pools, staking, and yield farming, deployed on the Binance Smart Chain.<br/><br/>
